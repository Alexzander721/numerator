# automatic numbering plugin
This plugin allows polygons to be numbered using the max Y values and the total uniting field (optional). 
The numbering is made from the top object to the bottom. First, you need to open a vector polygonal layer and select it in the plugin's list of layers. 
Then we select the necessary settings and start the process.
